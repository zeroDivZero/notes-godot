# SIGNAL

Nodes emit signals when events occur, how nodes communicate without being hard-wired (observer pattern).

For example, button emits signal when pressed. Can connect signal to run code in reaction to this event, like opening menu.

Other built-in signals include two objects collided, character entered given area, etc. Can also define custom signals.
